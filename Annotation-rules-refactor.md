# Annotation Scheme for Social Interactions in Ruby's Mission

**How to use this document?** TODO: write a short paragraph on how to use this document.

# Background

The annotations for social interaction are based on the Stimulus-Response (SR-)model from psychology. Social interaction is the way in which persons mutually influence one another (Bardis, 1979). The SR-model says that every social action is determined by the previous social action of another person (Argyle, 2017). Our annotation rules are based upon this model of social interaction. It has been slightly adjusted to better fit within our specific context.

# Annotation rules

The present scheme only considers verbal actions for annotations. A **verbal action** is any sound an individual produces with their voice that contains language. Verbal actions are categorized as either a [stimulus](#stimulus), as a [response](#response), or as [ambiguous](#ambiguous). In the present annotation scheme a **conversation** refers to a stimulus followed by _at least one_ response. 

Following this section is a extensive overview of the rules for annotating verbal actions according to the present annotation scheme. For a compact overview of the annotation rules, please refer to the [overview of the annotation rules](#overview-of-the-annotation-rules).

### Stimulus 

A **stimulus** is either **(a)** a verbal action that is meant to be responded to by others _verbally_ (i.e. through a verbal action), or  _in-game_ (i.e. through an action in the video game); or **(b)** a verbal action that others respond to _verbally_, even though this was not the speakers intention. A stimulus may also be used as a response during social interaction. These verbal actions (that are both stimulus and response) are annotated as a _response_ in the present annotation scheme (see [Section "Response"](#Response), Rule 2).

The stimulus category has been subdivided into multiple sub-categories relevant for our social context. **(Rule 1)** A verbal action is considered a stimulus when it fits within any of the following sub-categories:

  - **(Cat. 1) Question:** a verbal action that contains a _question_ directed to at least one _other_ person in the group.
  
  - **(Cat. 2) Command:** a verbal action that contains a _command_ directed to at least one _other_ person in the group.

  - **(Cat. 3) Remark about:** a verbal action contains a _remark about_ at least one _other_ person in the group.
    
  - **(Cat. 4) Remark to:** a verbal action contains a _remark_ meant for at least one _other_ person in the group. Verbal actions about the shared task (i.e. the gameplay) are also considered as this sub-category.
    
    Verbal actions that consist of reading out-loud what is on the screen are **not** considered this category (4). You may find all information on written texts in the [mini-game section](#mini-games) for reference during annotating.
    
  - **(Cat. 5) Unintentional:** any verbal actions that _another_ person in the group responds to, even though this may not have been the speakers intention.


### Response

A **response** (category 6) is any verbal action that is a reaction to **another person's _verbal action_** (stimulus or response) **(Rule 2)**. Below are the rules regarding the annotation of responses:

- **(Rule 3)** A stimulus can be used as a response. In this case, the verbal action is **always** annotated as a response (cat. 6). Consider the example below:
  
  > **Verzamelaar:** "Ga die kant op!" (cat.  2)\
  > **Bestuurder:** "Welke kant?" (cat.  6)\
  > **Verzamelaar:** "Naar rechts." (cat.  6)
  
  The first line in the example is a command (category 2) directed to the driver to move in a certain direction. On the second line, the driver _responds with a question_ (category 6) asking for clarification on the exact direction to move to. Finally, the collector _responds with a remark about the shared task_ (category 6), providing clarification on the correct direction. Since both verbal actions on line 2 and 3 are responses to a prior stimulus or response, they must both be categorized as a response.

- **(Rule 4)** When a person follows up with multiple consecutive verbal actions within the context of a response to another person, each of these verbal actions are categorized as a response. For example:

  > **Kind 1:** "Hoe denk jij dat Thijs zich kan voelen?" (cat. 1)\
  > **Kind 2:** "Hmm, ik denk misschien wel boos..." (cat. 6)\
  > \*silence\*\
  > **Kind 2:** "En ook wel jaloers!" (cat. 6)

- **(Rule 5)** During a conversation the topic of the conversation may transition smoothly. In this case, consecutive verbal actions are continued to be categorized as responses. When a verbal action introduces an abrupt change of topic, the action is **not** categorized as a response. Consider this example during the scenario mini-game for the emotion 'jealousy'. 

  > **Kind 1:** "Hoe zou Thijs zich kunnen voelen?" (cat. 1)\
  > **Kind 2:** "Jaloers." (cat. 6)\
  > [...]\
  > **Kind 2:** "En eeh... Boos." (cat. 6)\
  > **Kind 1:** "Boos, maar ook bang." (cat. 6)\
  > [...]\
  > **Kind 1:** "Hij is bang." (cat. 6)
  > 
  > _// Hier vindt een smooth transitie plaats van hoe Thijs zich zou kunnen voelen naar waarom Thijs bang zou zijn. Opeenvolgende verbale acties op hetzelfde onderwerp gaan door als response._
  > 
  > **Kind 2:** "Hoezo is die bang?" (cat. 6)\
  > **Kind 1:** "Hij kan zich, wacht even hoor [...] Hij kan zich verbranden." (cat. 6)\
  > **Kind 2:** "Mijn ou... Mijn ouders zijn bang. Niet hijzelf." (cat. 6)
  >
  > _// Hier vindt een abrupte transitie plaats van waarom Thijs zich bang zou kunnen voelen, naar hoe Thijs zich zou kunnen voelen. Deze nieuwe verbale actie wordt in dit geval gecategoriseerd als stimulus._
  > 
  > **Kind 1:** "Ik zeg eerlijk. Hij voelt zich ook blij" (cat. 4) 


### Ambiguous

Situations may arise in which it is **ambiguous** (category 7) how to categorize a verbal action. The following rules are in place to handle these situations:

- **(Rule 6)** When it is ambiguous whether a verbal action categorizes as a response **and** the verbal action clearly categorizes as a stimulus, the verbal action is then annotated as a stimulus (i.e. cat. 1 to 5).

- **(Rule 7)** When it is not evident if a verbal action categorizes as a stimulus or as a response, the verbal action is categorized as ambiguous (cat. 7).

- **(Rule 8)** When it is evident that a verbal action does **not** categorize as a stimulus or as a response, the verbal action is **not** categorized (i.e. left unlabeled).


## Overview of the Annotation Rules

This section provides a compact overview of the annotation rules. Please refer to the previous sections for more extensive descripitions.

- **(Rule 1)** A verbal action is considered a **stimulus** when it fits within any of its sub-categories: (cat. 1) question, (cat. 2) command, (cat. 3) remark about another in the group, (cat. 4) remark directed to at least one other person in the group, or (cat. 5) unintended stimuli (verbal actions that others respond to, although this may not have been intended).

- **(Rule 2)** A verbal action is considered a **response** (cat. 6) when this action is a reaction to **another person's _verbal action_** (stimulus or response)

- **(Rule 3)** A stimulus can be used as a response. In this case, the verbal action is **always** annotated as a response (cat. 6).
  
- **(Rule 4)** When a person follows up with multiple consecutive verbal actions within the context of a response to another person, each of these verbal actions are categorized as a response.

- **(Rule 5)** During a conversation the topic of the conversation may transition smoothly. In this case, consecutive verbal actions are continued to be categorized as responses. When a verbal action introduces an abrupt change of topic, the action is **not** categorized as a response.

- **(Rule 6)** When it is ambiguous whether a verbal action categorizes as a response **and** the verbal action clearly categorizes as a stimulus, the verbal action is then annotated as a stimulus (i.e. cat. 1 to 5).

- **(Rule 7)** When it is not evident if a verbal action categorizes as a stimulus or as a response, the verbal action is categorized as ambiguous (cat. 7).

- **(Rule 8)** When it is evident that a verbal action does **not** categorize as a stimulus or as a response, the verbal action is **not** categorized (i.e. left unlabeled).


# Mini Games

TODO: add descriptions for the various mini-games. Include screenshots for each of the screens such that the annotators know what is on the screen. 


# Adjustments in the annotation scheme

- Might need to clarify the definition of category 6, _"All verbal actions using language as a response to another person's verbal or non-verbal actions"_. Two reasons for this consideration are:
   - The data is often ambiguous on whether or not the participants respond to an in-game action.
   - Typical responses to non-verbal actions are singular, meaning that only a single response (per person) is given on an action.
  
  To resolve this issue, we ~may consider removing~ removed the _"non-verbal actions"_ part from category 6.

- For category 4, _"Remarks that are **about** at least one other person in the group"_, it is often ambiguous between when a remark was actually intended to be communicated to another and when it was merely a remark to the person self.
   - We may resolve this by adding a rule that **all** remarks about the common task (the game) are considered remarks to others.
   - ~We may **not** annotate these interactions at all.~
