# Annotation Schema

The annotations for social interaction are based on the Stimulus-Response (SR) model from psychology. This model says that every social action is determined by the previous social action of another person (Argyle, 2017). Social interaction is the way in which persons mutually influence one another (Bardis, 1979). Our rules are based upon this model of social interaction, and has been slightly adjusted to better fit within a video game context. Every _verbal action_ is considered social interaction when it fits in one of the following categories:

  
**Stimuli**

1) Questions.

2) Commands.

3) Remarks that are **about** at least one _other_ person in the group.

4) Remarks that are **directed** at at least one _other_ person in the group.

5) _Verbal actions_ that others respond to.

**Response**

6) All verbal actions using language as a response to **another person's** _verbal actions_. When one person continues with multiple _verbal actions_ within the context of the response to the other person, each of these _verbal actions_ is categorised as a response. Only when the subject of the interaction changes, can a repeated _verbal action_ be categorized as another category. 


## Rules for annotating

- A _verbal action_ is any sound that is produced by an individual and that contains language.

- A _response_ (cat. 6) is any _verbal action_ that is triggered by a prior stimulus or response.

- Any _verbal action_ that is a response (cat. 6) is always annotated as a response. Only when a _verbal action_ is not a response, can it be annotated as a stimulus (categories 1 to 5). For example, when a person asks a _question_ (cat. 1) as a _response_ (cat. 6) to another person, this action is annotated as category 6. 

- When it is _unclear_ if a _verbal action_ is a response (cat. 6) and the action fits well within any of the stimuli, the action is annotated as stimulus (i.e. cat. 1 to 5). 

- When it is _unclear_ if a _verbal action_ falls within **any** of the categories, it is marked **ambiguous**.

- When a _verbal action_ is not a _response_ (cat. 6) and it is _ambiguous_ to which _stimuli_ (i.e. categories 1 to 5) the action belongs, it is marked **ambiguous**.

- All _verbal actions_ about the shared task (i.e. the game) that are not a response, are annoted as category 4. _Verbal actions_ that consist of reading out loud what is on the screen are **not** annotated as category 4. 


## Adjustments in the annotation scheme

- Might need to clarify the definition of category 6, _"All verbal actions using language as a response to another person's verbal or non-verbal actions"_. Two reasons for this consideration are:
   - The data is often ambiguous on whether or not the participants respond to an in-game action.
   - Typical responses to non-verbal actions are singular, meaning that only a single response (per person) is given on an action.
  
  To resolve this issue, we ~may consider removing~ removed the _"non-verbal actions"_ part from category 6.

- For category 4, _"Remarks that are **about** at least one other person in the group"_, it is often ambiguous between when a remark was actually intended to be communicated to another and when it was merely a remark to the person self.
   - We may resolve this by adding a rule that **all** remarks about the common task (the game) are considered remarks to others.
   - ~We may **not** annotate these interactions at all.~
